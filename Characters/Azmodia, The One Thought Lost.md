&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Azmodia, "The One Thought Lost" is a naive draken concubine. He was thought to be exterminated with the rest of the Brightweaver clan, after the extermination. He is the younger brother to "[Draakon, The Broken Light](./Draakon,%20The%20Broken%20Light.md)," and Half brother to the clan's traitor "[Uzoniitoth, of Dead Scales](./Uzoniitoth,%20of%20Dead%20Scales.md)."Uzoniitoth hide Azmodia from the conquerors when he orchestrated their attack. Azmodia serves as Uzoniitoth's concubine slave. After the conqueror's left he and Azmodia left the old stronghold and he branded him with the same mark he has. This mark symbolizes their connection and marks them with the lover's bond. As long as they both love each other the symbol prevents them from being separated. He is very young and does not remember his life before becoming a concubine.
