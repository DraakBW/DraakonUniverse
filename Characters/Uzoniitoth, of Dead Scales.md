# **Backstory:**
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uzoniitoth, "of dead scales," is a brilliant draken necrotic magic user. He is the only known living member of the Deadwatcher's clan, after the brightweaver's won over them. An Ace Student at the schools and University. He is the older half-brother to "[Azmodia, The One Thought Lost](./Azmodia,%20The%20One%20Thought%20Lost.md)," and "[Draakon, The Broken Light](./Draakon,%20The%20Broken%20Light.md)." He was treated poorly by his stepfather, who married his mother after then Deadwatcher's merged into the brightweaver's clan. He was always jealous of Draakon, who tried his best to be a good brother but was poor in his social skills at the time.  The human clan known as the conquerors, contacted him knowing he was envious to try and find a way to infiltrated the Brightweaver stronghold. They promised Uzoniitoth that they would let him live. So he agreed but hid Azmodia thinking his younger half brother was too innocent and adorable to let die. After the conqueror's left he and Azmodia left the old stronghold and he branded him with the same mark he has. This mark symbolizes their connection and marks them with the lover's bond. As long as they both love each other the symbol prevents them from being separated.
