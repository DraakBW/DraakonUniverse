# Welcome To My Knowledge Base

## What is this?
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my way of sharing my writings for my OCs and the lore of my universe I am creating for potential novels I might work on. I am still in the early stages of creation. I am using Obsidian to create all the various text files.

## Do I have permission to use these notes for myself?
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individual characters are not up for use, unless I have given express permission. Please respect that, I can't stop you but I would like to be unlinked from anything not related to my characters. I however will will allow use of the universe. So if you want to add your own story in my universe with your own characters I am more than happy to allow that and would like to read whatever you decide to write.
